In this project I analyze the results of the two best Spanish football teams, Real Madrid and Barcelona, in their matches in the Spanish Football League (La Liga) using European Soccer Database containing data from years 2008-2016. 

Here, I use SQL queries and Pyhon to perform the analysis.

The data base can found here:
